# ✅ No Server Needed!

I've updated your portfolio to work **entirely in your browser** - no Node.js, no server, no installation needed!

## How to Use:

### 1. Open the Portfolio
- Just double-click `index.html` in the `public` folder
- Or open it in your browser
- It works immediately!

### 2. Use the Admin Panel
- Click the "Admin" link at the bottom
- Or open `admin.html` directly
- Password: `admin123`
- **No server needed!**

## What Changed:

✅ **Works offline** - no internet needed (except for Google Fonts)
✅ **No installation** - just open the HTML files
✅ **No server** - everything runs in your browser
✅ **Same features** - add text, upload images/videos, edit content

## How It Works:

- Content is stored in your browser's localStorage
- Images/videos are converted to base64 and stored in the browser
- Everything persists between page refreshes
- Works on any computer, no setup needed

## Limitations:

- File size limits: Images max 2MB, Videos max 10MB (browser storage limits)
- Content is stored locally in your browser (not on a server)
- If you clear browser data, content will be lost (but you can export/import)

## To Use:

1. **Open `public/index.html`** in your browser
2. **Click "Admin"** at the bottom
3. **Enter password:** `admin123`
4. **Start adding content!**

That's it! No server, no installation, no hassle! 🎉
