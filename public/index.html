            <p class="header-bio">Adam R Garcia is a creative leader with years of experience shaping culture at scale, most recently as Creative Director at Apple Music. His background bridges global brand leadership with an independent studio and writing practice in cultural production.<br><br>He recently completed a Master of Science in Fiction + Entertainment at SCI-Arc, and his work explores how design, storytelling, and speculative futures can reframe meaning in a world where creativity must evolve beyond traditional models. He believes in building systems, stories, and experiences that are both culturally resonant and necessary for how we imagine and create an empathetic future while reframing what the role of a creator in our current systems can be.</p>
