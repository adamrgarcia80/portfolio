3. **Click the big green "Download Node.js (LTS)" button**
4. **Open the downloaded file** (it will be in your Downloads folder)
5. **Follow the installation wizard** (just click "Next" or "Continue" on everything)
6. **When it says "Installation complete" - you're done!**

### Step 2: Restart Your Terminal

- **Close your Terminal app completely**
- **Open it again** (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")

### Step 3: Start the Server

Copy and paste these commands ONE AT A TIME into Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Cursor/Portfolio
```

Press Enter, then:

```bash
npm install
```

Press Enter and wait for it to finish (this might take a minute), then:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 4: You Should See:

```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**✅ SUCCESS!** The server is now running!

### Step 5: Use the Admin Panel

1. **Open your web browser**

3. **You should see a green "✓ Server connected" message**
4. **Enter password:** `admin123`

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- **Keep the Terminal window open** - if you close it, the server stops
- **Don't close Terminal** while using the admin panel
- If you see errors, make sure you completed Step 1 (installing Node.js)

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. Make sure you **restarted Terminal** after installing Node.js
2. Check that you're in the right folder: `~/Desktop/Cursor/Portfolio`
3. Try typing `node --version` in Terminal - you should see a version number
